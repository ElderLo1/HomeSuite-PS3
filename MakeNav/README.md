# MakeNav
MakeNav is a python script aimed at Python 3 for the purpose of streamlining the process of creating Navigator XML files for PlayStation Home. It is especially useful for making the Navigator look more like a Retail build's navigator compared to the built-in Dev Navigator UI.

This tool will not work on pre-1.35 Home clients, as those use the World Map instead of the Navigator.

## Dependencies
You will need the following:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- BeautifulSoup4 (pip install BeautifulSoup4)
- lxml (pip install lxml)
- A SCENELIST.XML or LOCALSCENELIST.XML file to parse
- Some knowledge on how to use a command line program

## Usage
(WIP)

Sample: "makeNav.py -s path/to/scenelist.xml"

Extra arguments include:
- -i/--imageUrlRoot "WEB_SERVER_IP_OR_DOMAIN_GOES_HERE"
- -f/--addFunctions 0/1 (A value of 1 enables "My Home" category containing extra functions such as Favorites and Recently Visited)

If it succeeded, you should see nav.xml in the working directory.

## Am I done just like that?
You can use the navigator file generated by this program as soon as it's made. However, you can also tidy up your newfound navigator file by adding more categories and the like.

## Can I make a fork of this?
Sure can, just be sure to give appropriate credit to me. Also, if one wishes to tidy up my hacky code, please do. I'd love to see this little tool get better.

## Work that currently needs to be done.
- Implement handling of scenes inside REGION tags
- Do more testing on different scenelists (i.e. DH's offline build scenelist)
- Figure out a way to let the user sort scenes in the Explore category by a creator id. (For now, the user has to edit the nav file manually. It works if they know what they're doing but I'm trying to think of a way to deal with this without editing the sceneist or creting huge arrays of predefined names)
