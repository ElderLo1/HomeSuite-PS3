# Scenes
This contains scenes that DH's archive is missing for some reason.

Primarily here to archive the SCEJ Cinema Lobby (WHY was this missing? They've had it for a while, one of Nagato's videos prove that.)

If I come across several other scenes that are missing i'll archive them here.

Feel free to make issues or PRs containing new scenes.

## But why?
Because hoarding these files isn't good for Home preservation. I don't think there's any excuse to hoard vital files that could potentially aid in the preservation of Home. This stuff deserves to have some form of a proper archival and I intend to at least aid in that.

## How often will this be updated?
As often as I can find un-archived scenes. I don't have many potential excuses outside of my personal life and a lack of scenes to go off of, so it really depends on those two factors (primarily the second one -- finding Home data is hard in this landscape, quite sad from a preservation standpoint.)

## Objects, too?
Not yet, but I might consider it sometime.
